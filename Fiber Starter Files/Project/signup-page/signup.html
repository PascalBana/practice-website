          I offered you wealth, property, money. All the simple things of a corporate role and more. I offered you magic. Secrets. Revenge. A place by the river, the lights on the water at night. I invited you to share the dreams of a child, to sense the skin of another's sex, to hear all with the ears of a bat, to see with the eyes of a hawk, to smell with the nose of a hound. I could have given you thoughts in an unimaginable brilliant colour, or dabbling in the visions of an addict on the edge of death and seeing what he sees as he passes beyond, a glimpse of something more. We could have put you on the same eyeline as God Himself. I offered you visions, wonders, comfort, security. Whatever you desired. But you refused me. So then I offer you this alternative. Run, hide children because I've seen your faces and I can recognize you now; wherever you go, whatever you do, my men will follow you, track you by the prints from your fingers from the sound of your footsteps, and we will find you. And I will kill you and show your mangled corpse to my clients and say “These are the dead bones you were afraid of, and look how they died. I will do this to your enemies if you name them”. I shall have your skull on my desk as a paperweight and wish that you still had eyes to see my victory. This is my new offer. This is my promise to you.
